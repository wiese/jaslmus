# jaslmus - *ja*va*s*cript *l*ecture *mus*icale

## Idea

Implement a browser-based version of the somewhat famous but dated [Jalmus](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jalmus/), and do so by using great modern day open source software to focus on the domain at hand - learning something about music theory in the process.
